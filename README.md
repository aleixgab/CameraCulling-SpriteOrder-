# Sprite Ordering and Camera Culling

My name is Aleix Gabarro and Iâ€™m a university videogame developer student from Catalonia in Polytechnic University specifically in [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/). I will explain you my personal research about camera culling and sprite ordering. This is used for the second year in ProjectII, where the students have to create a game under supervision of lecturer [Ricard Pillosu]( https://es.linkedin.com/in/ricardpillosu).
Firstly I will start explain all Camera culling with their own exercises and then I will continue to Sprite ordering.
