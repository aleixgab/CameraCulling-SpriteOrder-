Hi, I'm Aleix, a student at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, this is my personal research on how you can make a good camera culling and sprite ordering. this [web page](https://aleixgab.github.io/SpriteOrdering-CameraCulling/) explains in profundity how you can do it step by step.

In game:

- You can move the player with WASD
- You can move the camera with arrows keys
